The Identity Python consists of a set of inter-related but separate software projects sharing common funding and governance.
IdPy has multiple communication channels;
- the [IdPy mailing list][idpy-ml] provided by [SUNET](https://sunet.se) (send messages to the list address [discuss@idpy.org](mailto:discuss@idpy.org)),
- the [IdPy slack workspace][idpy-slack] ([invitation][idpy-slack-invite])
- and project-specific mailing lists

Participation in all Identity Python projects is govered by our [Note Well](https://github.com/IdentityPython/Governance/blob/master/Note-Well.md). Expectations regarding code submission and request for project adoption are found in our (Projects)[https://github.com/IdentityPython/Governance/blob/master/idpy-projects.md] page.
