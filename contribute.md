The Identity Python consists of a set of inter-related but separate software
projects sharing common funding and governance. Right now there is a common
mailing list for discussions about the Identity Python provided by [SUNET](https://sunet.se).

Participation in all Identity Python projects is govered by our [Note Well](https://github.com/IdentityPython/Governance/blob/master/Note-Well.md).

To subscribe to the list go to [https://lists.sunet.se/listinfo/idpy-discuss](https://lists.sunet.se/listinfo/idpy-discuss). To send messages to the list address [discuss@idpy.org](mailto:discuss@idpy.org)
